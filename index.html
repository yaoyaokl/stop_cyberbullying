      <h2>What is cyberbullying?</h2>

      <p>
        Cyberbullying is bullying that takes place over digital devices like cell phones, computers, and tablets. Cyberbullying can occur through SMS, Text, and apps, or online in social media, forums, or gaming where people can view, participate in, or share content. Cyberbullying includes sending, posting, or sharing negative, harmful, false, or mean content about someone else. It can include sharing personal or private information about someone else causing embarrassment or humiliation. Some cyberbullying crosses the line into unlawful or criminal behavior.

    <section class="why">

      <h2>Impacts of cyberbullying on the community / society</h2>

      <p>
        When bullying happens online it can feel as if you are being attacked everywhere, even inside your own home. It can seem like there is no escape. The effects can last a long time and affect a person in many ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Mentally - feeling upset, embarrassed, stupid, even angry</li>
        <li>Emotionally - feeling ashamed or losing interest in the things you love</li>
        <li>Physically - tired (loss of sleep), or experiencing symptoms like stomach aches and headaches</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The feeling of being laughed at or harassed by others, can prevent people from speaking up or trying to deal with the problem. In extreme cases, cyberbullying can even lead to people taking their own lives.
      </p>

      <p>
        Cyberbullying can affect us in many ways. But these can be overcome and people can regain their confidence and health.
