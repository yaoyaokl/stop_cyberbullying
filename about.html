      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a secondary student studying in Thailand. Due to the effects of the pandemic, my lifestyle has changed drastically over the past months. Most aspects of my life have been converted online, so I have spent a lot of time on social media. Hence, I started observing and noticed something distressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I initially thought was a place for relaxation and entertainment had become a platform for people to direct negativity and hatred towards one another. As I became more concerned, I did further research. I found out that many online users have experienced some form of cyberbullying, which has even led to severe consequences in multiple cases.
        This alarming issue indeed concerns me, which is why I have decided to take action by creating this forum. I want to make actual changes by advocating for positivity on social media and trying my best to reduce the prevalence of cyberbullying in one way or another.
